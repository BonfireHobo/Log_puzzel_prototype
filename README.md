Prototype for a python terminal game

PLEASE READ THIS IN RAW!!!!!!

This is just a prototype of a python terminal game I wanted to make to test my python skills after a long time away from programming.
The game has a lot of bad practice in it but it was just to check if i could solve the problems of making the game work and see if the concept was an good.
If people like the concept and playing the prototype i might work some more on it and try to make it into a real game with better code.

Here is an little intruduction and a tutorial on how you play the game:

GENERAL INFO:

Always press enter after you have chosen an action.

IN THE HOMESCREEN:

The first thing you'll see when you open up the game is the homescreen. On the top you'll se the title of the game.
Under the title you'll see 5 boxes, the first from the left has the number one in the middle, the four other are just 3x3 whith "#".
This indicate that just the first og five levels are avalible for you to play.
You unlock levels by completing the level before.
Use "a" and "d" to change between the levels you want to play.
When an level is selected it will look like this:
- - -
| 1 |

When it's not selected it will look like this:

PLAYING A LEVEL:

When you start to play a level you'll se which level you're currently playing.

The object of the game is to get the log from the start to the goal
"-" is start and "+" is the goal.
"@" or "@ @" is the log.
    To move the log use: WASD
 The log can either be standing("@") or laying down ("@ @")
 If the log is standing it will always fall down on its side no mater which way you push it.
 If the log is laying on its side, it can either be flipped up if you push move it on the short side, or be rolled if you move it on the long side.
 "#" are walls and you can not roll the log through them or on top of them.
 
 To win the level you have to get the log standing up ("@") on the goal ("@")
 
 If you get stuck you can press "r" to restart the level and go back to the start.
 If you want to exit the level and go back to the homescreen, press "q"
